## Artwork Detail Transition Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies whenever an illustration card opens
`IllustDetailPage`. It prevents a work with the same Pixiv ID in two mounted
surfaces from being treated as the same Hero transition.

### 2. Signatures

```dart
const IllustCard({
  required IllustEntity entity,
  String heroScope = 'feed',
});

const IllustDetailPage({
  required int illustId,
  IllustEntity? initialEntity,
  String heroScope = 'feed',
});

String illustHeroTag(String scope, int illustId);
```

### 3. Contracts

- A list chooses one stable, code-defined scope for its surface. The card and
  the detail route it opens use the same scope and integer work ID.
- Independent mounted surfaces use different scopes (`recommended`,
  `ranking`, `new`, `search`, and a profile feed key).
- `initialEntity` is the card snapshot used to build the first detail frame;
  the detail request may refresh the shared store after navigation.
- A detail route without a matching source Hero uses the normal page route; it
  must not create a synthetic source or wait for the request before navigating.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Card and detail scopes match | Image Hero may participate in the transition. |
| Same work ID appears in another surface | Different tag, so no cross-surface flight. |
| No source card or no snapshot | Normal route/loading state remains observable. |
| API refresh fails with a snapshot | Snapshot content remains renderable and retry stays available. |
| Current profile is rendered | No settings icon or `onSettings` navigation hook is present. |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: `IllustCard(heroScope: 'profile:42:bookmarks:illust:public')` opens a
  detail route with the same scope and `initialEntity`.
- Base: history/deep-link routes keep the default scope and no initial entity;
  Flutter performs the ordinary slide transition.
- Bad: every list uses `IllustHero-<id>`, allowing a newly bookmarked work in
  a profile list to match a mounted feed card.

### 6. Tests Required

- A first-frame detail widget test passes an entity snapshot and asserts the
  title, author, and scoped Hero exist before the request settles.
- Profile header tests assert `Icons.settings_outlined` is absent in expanded
  and collapsed states.
- Settings account-card tests assert exactly one profile push and no settings
  icon on the resulting `MePage`.
- Caption tests assert non-empty captions are visible without a `简介`
  control and preserve rich-link behavior.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```dart
Hero(tag: 'IllustHero-${entity.id}', child: image);
IllustDetailPage(illustId: entity.id);
```

Correct:

```dart
final tag = illustHeroTag(heroScope, entity.id);
Hero(tag: tag, child: image);
IllustDetailPage(
  illustId: entity.id,
  initialEntity: entity,
  heroScope: heroScope,
);
```
