## Overview

<!--
Document your project's state management conventions here.

Questions to answer:
- What state management solution do you use?
- How is local vs global state decided?
- How do you handle server state?
- What are the patterns for derived state?

### Shared Entity Store Merge Contract (`IllustStore.mergeAll`)

**What**: `IllustStore` (lib/core/entity/illust_store.dart) is the single account-scoped copy of illust entities; feeds hold only ordered ID lists, so Recommended cards, Detail page and Viewer must observe identical data. `mergeAll` is the only write path for API payloads.

**Merge direction is per-field and monotonic** — newer parse wins by default, EXCEPT these regression guards:

| Field | Direction | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `isBookmarked` | `new \|\| old` (OR) | an older feed snapshot that has not observed a bookmark yet must not clear it |
| `metaPages` / `metaSinglePageOriginalUrl` | keep old when incoming empty | detail → feed refresh must not strip viewer/download URLs |
| `caption` / `tags` | keep old non-empty when incoming empty | trimmed payloads must not erase richer values already rendered (parent AC: 详情字段不倒退) |
| `visible` | `new && old` (AND) | `visible: false` sticks once seen |
| `pageCount` | `max(new, old)` | a feed's `page_count=1` must not erase a detail multi-page count |

**Rule for new `IllustEntity` fields**: every field added to `IllustEntity` MUST get an explicit merge decision in `mergeAll` plus a merge test in test/illust_store_test.dart asserting the no-regression direction. Fields defaulting to "newer wins" are acceptable only when a real endpoint always re-sends them.

**Wrong**: calling `store.mergeAll([fresh])` then rendering a captured pre-merge entity — read back via `store.get(id)` after merging (detail controller does exactly this so Ready state shows merged data).
